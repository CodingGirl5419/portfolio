<h1>About me:</h1>
<img src="Lilac.jpeg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
<p>Alexandra Biehle</p>
<p>Age: 16</p>
<p>Birthday: March 4th 2001</p>
<p>Location: NYC</p>
<p>My name is Alexandra and</p>
<p>I created this website with GWC.</p>
<p>Some facts about me are that I</p>
<p>have a puppy, named Teddy,</p>
<p>I LOVE playing The Sims 2 and I know some ASL.</p>
<h1>Reflection on lists:</h1>
<p>A list is a list of numbers within a list
<p>and it's useful because you can decide which number in the list to print.</p>
<h1>Reflection on Obamacon</h1>
<p>I liked the end result of the filter on the image.</P>
<p>My partner and I had trouble understanding how to code
<p>to change the color of the pixels.</p>
<p>We used the core4 in our project by creating a condition to change the color, </p>
<p>a function to make it function, a loop to make it continue until the condition was met and </p>
<p>a variable for pixels and intensity.</p>
<p>If I had more time, I would make a rainbow filter.</p>
