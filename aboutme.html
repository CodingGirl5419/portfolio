<h1>About me:</h1>
<button onclick="changeBackground()">Click me</button>
<img id="image" src="Lilac.jpeg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
<p>Alexandra Biehle</p>
<p>Age: 16</p>
<p>Birthday: March 4th 2001</p>
<p>Location: NYC</p>
<p>My name is Alexandra and</p>
<p>I created this website with GWC.</p>
<p>Some facts about me are that I</p>
<p>have a puppy, named Teddy,</p>
<p>I LOVE playing The Sims 2 and I know some ASL.</p>
<h1>Reflection on lists</h1>
<p>A list is a list of numbers within a list
<p>and it's useful because you can decide which number in the list to print.</p>

<h1>Reflection on Obamacon</h1>
<p>I liked the end result of the filter on the image.</P>
<p>My partner and I had trouble understanding how to code
<p>to change the color of the pixels.</p>
<p>We used the core4 in our project by creating a condition to change the color, </p>
<p>a function to make it function, a loop to make it continue until the condition was met and </p>
<p>a variable for pixels and intensity.</p>
<p>If I had more time, I would make a rainbow filter.</p>

<h1>Robotics</h1>
<p>I learned what a circuit is suppose to look like and what some of the parts do.</p>
<p>My group had some challenges when we were trying to make the LED part</p>
<p>of the circuit light up, but we ended up plugging the "resistor" to another power source.</p>
<p>For the second part of the project, we tried to make each LED light up at a different time,</p>
<p>but two LEDs were connected and one was not. So, we were trying to make the two that were connected,</p>
<p>not connected. Our team tried to work consistently, but we did not end up completing our goal.</p>
<p>Our team could have ignored the distractions around us and kept on working, but we got distracted anyway.</p>
<p>I did not know anything about circuits or robotics before we started working with them, so everything was new</p>
<p>to me. My group made our robot dance, but we could have timed the dancing to the music better and made</p>
<p>the dance longer, if we had more time.</p>

<h1>Reflection on Java Script</h1>
<p>I learned that you can change how the user interacts with the webpage through JS.</p>
<p>I think LaTeX is a markup language because it is based on formatting.</p>
<p>I thought Yuki's website looked really well done because it had advanced features on it that</p>
<p>a beginner wouldn't know. A challenge I faced today was to be able to change the background image</p>
<p>of the website to another background image by clicking on a button. I managed to create the button, however,</p>
<p>I could not get the code to correspond with the button.</p>
